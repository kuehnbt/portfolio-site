# From DevOps to Game Development

Hi! I'm a DevOps engineer with over 10 years of experience building and scaling infrastructure for high-traffic applications. Now, I'm channeling that expertise into my true passion: game development.

## Why Game Development?

I've always been fascinated by games - not just playing them, but understanding how they work under the hood. My DevOps background gives me a unique perspective on game backend development:

- **Scalability**: I've built systems handling millions of concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Expert in creating fault-tolerant architectures with 99.99% uptime
- **Performance**: Deep understanding of optimization, caching, and distributed systems
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Bringing modern DevOps practices to game server deployment

## My Journey

- **2014-2024**: DevOps Engineer specializing in Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud infrastructure
- **2024**: Started learning game development with Godot and Unity
- **Current**: Building portfolio projects that combine gaming with infrastructure expertise

## What I Bring to Gaming

My DevOps experience translates directly to critical gaming infrastructure needs:

- **Multiplayer Backend Systems**: Building scalable game servers
- **Matchmaking Services**: Distributed systems for player matching
- **Live Operations**: CI/CD pipelines for game updates
- **Analytics Pipelines**: Real-time player data processing
- **Anti-Cheat Systems**: Security-focused infrastructure

## Current Focus

I'm actively learning:
- Game networking and multiplayer architecture
- Godot Engine for game client development
- Game-specific backend patterns (ECS, tick-based systems)
- Gaming industry best practices

Let's build something amazing together!
