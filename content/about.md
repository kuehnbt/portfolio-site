# Building Tomorrow's Gaming Infrastructure

I'm Ben Kuehn, a DevOps architect with over a decade of experience designing and scaling infrastructure for enterprise financial systems. Now, I'm pivoting my expertise toward the gaming industry, where technical challenges meet creative innovation.

## The Journey

My career has been defined by solving complex infrastructure problems at scale:

- **10+ years** architecting cloud-native solutions
- **Millions of users** served by systems I've built
- **99.99% uptime** achieved through robust automation
- **$100M+ in infrastructure** managed and optimized

But beneath the enterprise exterior beats the heart of a gamer. I've been fascinated by games since my first lines of BASIC on a Commodore 64. Now, I'm combining my infrastructure expertise with my passion for interactive experiences.

## Why Gaming?

The gaming industry faces unique technical challenges that perfectly align with my expertise:

### Multiplayer Infrastructure
- Real-time synchronization at massive scale
- Low-latency networking across global regions
- Dynamic server provisioning based on player demand

### Live Operations
- Zero-downtime deployments for live games
- A/B testing and feature flagging for millions
- Real-time monitoring and incident response

### Performance at Scale
- Handling viral growth and flash crowds
- Optimizing costs while maintaining player experience
- Building anti-cheat and security systems

## What I Bring

My transition isn't starting from zero. Every skill I've honed in enterprise DevOps translates directly to gaming:

### Technical Foundation
- **Kubernetes mastery**: Orchestrating game servers like microservices
- **Automation expertise**: CI/CD pipelines for game builds and deployments
- **Cloud architecture**: Multi-region, fault-tolerant game backends
- **Performance optimization**: Sub-millisecond response times

### Unique Perspective
- Enterprise-grade reliability for consumer experiences
- Cost optimization strategies from managing massive infrastructure
- Security-first mindset crucial for competitive gaming
- Data-driven decision making for live ops

## Current Focus

I'm actively building my game development skills while leveraging my infrastructure expertise:

- Learning **Godot** and **Unity** for hands-on game development
- Contributing to open-source game infrastructure projects
- Building portfolio projects that showcase scalable multiplayer systems
- Networking with game industry professionals

## Let's Connect

I'm looking for opportunities to bring enterprise-grade infrastructure practices to game development teams. Whether you need help scaling your multiplayer backend, optimizing your deployment pipeline, or building robust live ops systems, I'd love to discuss how my unique background can help.

The future of gaming is built on solid infrastructure. Let's build it together.
