## Overview

A production-ready game server orchestration platform that brings DevOps best practices to game server management. This system automatically provisions, scales, and manages game server instances based on real-time player demand.

## Features

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically spins up new game servers as player count increases
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic server replacement
- **Geographic Distribution**: Deploy servers across multiple regions for low latency
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically scales down during off-peak hours
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into server performance and player distribution

## Tech Stack

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Go**: Backend services and operators
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization
- **Redis**: Session management and matchmaking
- **gRPC**: Inter-service communication

## Architecture

The system consists of several microservices:

1. **Matchmaker Service**: Assigns players to optimal game servers
2. **Orchestrator Service**: Manages game server lifecycle
3. **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance data from game servers
4. **API Gateway**: RESTful API for game clients

## Key Learnings

Building this project taught me several important lessons about game infrastructure:

- Game servers have unique scaling patterns compared to web services
- Stateful services require careful orchestration during scaling events
- Player experience degrades rapidly with latency over 50ms
- Cost optimization is crucial - game servers can be expensive!

## Results

- Successfully tested with 10,000 concurrent players
- Achieved 99.9% uptime over 3-month test period
- Reduced server costs by 40% through intelligent scaling
- Average matchmaking time under 5 seconds

## Future Improvements

- Integration with multiple cloud providers
- Machine learning for predictive scaling
- Built-in DDoS protection
- Support for different game server types
