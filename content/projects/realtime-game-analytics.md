date: 2024-06-30
draft: false
summary: "Built a real-time analytics pipeline processing 1M+ events/second for player behavior analysis and live ops decisions."
---

## Overview

Designed and implemented a real-time analytics platform that processes millions of game events per second, providing instant insights for live operations teams and enabling data-driven game balancing.

## Problem Statement

A mobile gaming company needed to:
- Process 100M+ daily events in real-time
- Detect and respond to player churn signals
- A/B test game features with instant feedback
- Monitor game economy health

## Architecture

</div>

## Implementation Details

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **API Gateway**: Kong with rate limiting and authentication
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka handling 1M+ events/second
- **Schema Registry**: Avro schemas for event validation

### Stream Processing
```python
# Simplified event processor using Flink
@dataclass
class PlayerEvent:
    player_id: str
    event_type: str
    timestamp: int
    properties: dict

def process_event_stream():
    env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
    
    # Define Kafka source
    kafka_source = KafkaSource.builder() \
        .set_topics("game-events") \
        .set_value_only_deserializer(
            JsonRowDeserializationSchema.builder()
            .type_info(Types.ROW([Types.STRING(), Types.STRING()]))
            .build()
        ) \
        .build()
    
    # Process stream
    events = env.from_source(kafka_source, WatermarkStrategy.no_watermarks(), "Kafka Source")
    
    # Real-time metrics
    events \
        .key_by(lambda x: x.player_id) \
        .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(1))) \
        .aggregate(PlayerMetricsAggregator()) \
        .sink_to(analytics_sink)
```

### Analytics Features

#### 1. Player Behavior Tracking
- Session duration and frequency
- In-game purchase patterns
- Feature engagement metrics
- Social interaction analysis

#### 2. Real-Time Alerts
- Sudden drop in DAU/MAU
- Abnormal purchase patterns (potential fraud)
- Server performance degradation
- Game economy imbalances

#### 3. Live Dashboards
Built with Grafana showing:
- Current online players by region
- Revenue metrics in real-time
- Feature adoption rates
- A/B test performance

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Pipeline
- **Compression**: 70% reduction in storage using Snappy
- **Partitioning**: Time-based partitions for efficient queries
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed metrics

### Query Performance
```sql
-- Optimized query for player retention
WITH daily_players AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(timestamp) as play_date,
    player_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions
  FROM events
  WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
  play_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as dau,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
    WHEN LAG(play_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY play_date) = play_date - INTERVAL '1 day'
    THEN player_id 
  END) as retained_players
FROM daily_players
GROUP BY 1
```

## Results & Impact

### Technical Achievements
- **Throughput**: 1M+ events/second with <100ms latency
- **Uptime**: 99.99% availability over 6 months
- **Cost**: 60% reduction compared to previous solution

### Business Impact
- **Player retention**: +15% through targeted interventions
- **Revenue**: +25% via optimized pricing strategies
- **Feature adoption**: 2x faster iteration cycles
- **Support tickets**: -40% through proactive issue detection

## Technologies Used

- **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink, Kafka Streams
- **Storage**: Apache Druid, PostgreSQL, S3
- **Visualization**: Grafana, Superset
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, AWS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Alertmanager

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Scale**: Handling traffic spikes during events (10x normal load)
2. **Accuracy**: Exactly-once processing guarantees
3. **Latency**: Sub-second insights for 100M+ daily events
4. **Cost**: Optimizing infrastructure spend while maintaining performance

## Key Learnings

- **Start with the questions**: Define KPIs before building infrastructure
- **Plan for peaks**: Game events can cause 10x traffic spikes
- **Privacy matters**: GDPR/CCPA compliance from day one
- **Iterate quickly**: MVP approach with continuous improvements
