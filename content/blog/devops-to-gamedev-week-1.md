After 10 years in DevOps, I've finally taken the plunge into game development. Here's what I learned in my first week.

## Choosing the Right Engine

Coming from a background of evaluating tech stacks, I approached game engine selection like any infrastructure decision:

- **Performance requirements**: What kind of games do I want to build?
- **Learning curve**: How quickly can I be productive?
- **Community support**: Is there good documentation and help available?
- **Cost**: What's the licensing model?

I ended up choosing **Godot** for several reasons:
1. Open source (appeals to my DevOps sensibilities)
2. Lightweight and fast
3. GDScript is Python-like (familiar syntax)
4. Great for 2D games (where I'm starting)

## Surprising Parallels to DevOps

What struck me most was how many DevOps concepts translate directly to game development:

### State Management = Configuration Management
Just like managing server configurations, games need robust state management. Player inventory, game progress, settings - it's all state that needs to be carefully tracked and persisted.

### Game Loop = Event Loop
The game loop is essentially an event-driven architecture. Process input, update state, render output. It's like a very fast microservice!

### Performance Monitoring = Frame Profiling
Instead of monitoring CPU and memory on servers, I'm now profiling frame times and draw calls. Same principles, different metrics.

## First Project: A Simple Multiplayer Prototype

For my first project, I'm building a basic multiplayer game to leverage my networking experience:
- Simple 2D arena
- Basic player movement
- Authoritative server (no client-side cheating!)
- WebSocket-based networking

## Key Takeaways

1. **Documentation is everything** - Just like in DevOps, good documentation saves hours of debugging
2. **Start simple** - MVP principles apply to games too
3. **Version control from day one** - Games have assets, code, and configs that all need tracking
4. **Automate early** - Set up CI/CD for your game builds immediately

Next week, I'll dive into implementing the networking layer. Stay tuned!
